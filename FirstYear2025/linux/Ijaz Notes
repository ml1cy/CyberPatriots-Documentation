1. What ever James says to do, do the complete opposite. 
2. Don't use any of his scripts, they tend to corrupt your PAM file and in some cases your ENTIRE FUCKING IMAGE.
3. If you KNOW that you can do linux, RUSH to sign up for it because then an incompotent dumbass (*cough* JAMES *cough*) might get to it before you.

(Now for my Real Notes, But also seriously PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO JAMES. HE IS SETTING YOU UP FOR FAILURE!!)

1. Have general linux knowledge.
2. Don't be James.
3. Write scripts for everything.
4. Don't rely on AI for everything, It doesn't do great.
