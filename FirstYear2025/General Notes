- Ideas for better progression in the future:
    1. Start early (start preparing for the competition before summer)
    2. AI is a tool, not something that does everything for you
    3. Find VMs to help learn basic hardening skills
    4. Dont sign up unless you can ACTUALLY attend comp, ur taking up team space thats needed
    5. If you sign up and kirkenuinely do nothing but complain, PLEASE remove yourself from the competition
    6. If your name is James then don't bother signing up, you will be nothing but a bad luck charm.
    7. if your name is Ijaz, then don't bother coming, as you will get us a grand total of 18 points
